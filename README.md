# Linear Discriminant Analysis and Logistic Regression Project

This project showcases the implementation of **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)** and **Logistic Regression** for classification tasks. It includes custom implementations of LDA, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation using Python, designed to demonstrate both fundamental and advanced techniques.


## Project Overview
This project is divided into two main parts:
- **Custom Implementation of LDA:** A step-by-step implementation of Linear Discriminant Analysis, showcasing the mathematical concepts and decision boundary visualization.
- **Classification with LDA and Logistic Regression:** Using pre-built models from `scikit-learn`, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluating performance metrics to compare their effectiveness.
